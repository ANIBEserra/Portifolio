there are some oddly straight lines of white paint on my splatter cd. i keep watching the making of videos over and over again, but i’m confused lol. should i try to exchange it? or do you guys think this is a positive, rare defect? so screw toronto billie? opener got covid icymi, the opener will now not be performing tonight due to testing positive for covid. so i’ve been working on my shading, and i decided to draw the beautiful billie eilish. i think this turned out decent. we listen and we don’t judge. what are your hot takes about hit me hard and soft? for me, l’more doesn’t fit the album and only the extended version should’ve been released. also the diner and blue are the best songs. billie’s “hit me hard and soft” just dethroned taylor’s “the tortured poets department” as the most-streamed 2024 release on spotify! favorite song of billie’s new album hit me hard and soft?

(the positivity within this sub really inspired me to go for it). *whoever chooses this beautie’s name wins something special.* saw this on twitter and well.. this is positively horrifying peak chart position for bejeweled? so with anti-hero making it to #1, i'm wondering where bejeweled ended up on the charts. also, why hasn't it charted higher? it's a badass soon! ajay reacts to beautiful ghosts, lover remix + lover mv. great watch if you need something positive in these dark times! we had a “ resiliency day “ at my base. i was in charge of using chalk to write positive messages and of course i had to show my swiftie side ❤️ taylor swift's clean speech. bringing positivity into this sub my old journal vs my new one, hoping for some more positive vibes🌞🌞 i saw an interview where taylor swift said during her dark times with kanye drama she stayed positive by using an app to count down to things she was looking forward to. i’ve decided to try the same. this sub now has 1,300,000 members! lucky number 13 the day after her birthday! 1,5h in line, crazy overpriced, but cannot wait to play it taylor swift has been named “songwriter of the year” at the bmi pop awards for a second consecutive year 👑 seen on r/music. nice to see the positive comments! the wildest dreams cover i recently posted got some positive feedback, thank you all. here's enchanted done in the same style! (instrumental cover with her vocal track layered over, just my take on the song) some positivity. funny, and cute moments from 2016 karma is a cat! tarot tattoo i got today featuring my cat :) i'm pretty sure i saw my inspiration for this tattoo on this sub so shoutout to them! the lines look a little wonky because of how my arm is positioned for the picture but i'm so happy with how it turned out! it's that type of day. :( but knowing that taylor swift is sort of in a similar position to you makes it much better :) this week, my school had 'peace week'. we had to choose a person who has made a significant positive contribution to society and create a poster to hang from the ceiling throughout the school. i like my choice. all too well snl performance ranked as 13th best snl musical performances positive story about the merch store so i placed an order on friday dec 14 and it said pending for a few days. i then decided to cancel it so i sent an email and they cancelled it the same day. they did a great job. pretty glowing article about taylor on tumblr - finally some positivity “i come back stronger than a 90’s trend” a nice, positive article on why tswift is the best if lover is your favourite album, why? lover is my favourite album and i think it gets an undue amount of hate :) want to spread some lover positivity, if you love lover, why? thank you all for the positive vibes. taylor set to dominate all female billboard top 10 in the final predictions for the week taylor is set to take up the top 3 positions on this weeks billboard hot 100, with ‘is it over now?’ claiming number 1! \n",

      "these are the relevant settings in recommend(pic 2) and data saving(pic 3)\n",
      "i dislike these reuploads and music vids everytime they come but they keep popping up you can now select lyrics! when you click on the lyrics button! i know that spotify already had it but i actually thought youtube music had it too but i guess they didn’t.. but they just added it now! everything now is tiktok just got this new \"samples\" tab. basically a youtube shorts but only for music videos. weird. recap is here!! is this a bug or is it my phone only?? there are 2 song highlighted but only one is playing (ofcourse). does it only happen with me (or my phone)?? i've been facing this very frequently. idk it's same for albums, single, playlist. is there any specific reason for this?? finally got my winter recap! my winter recap (finally) i'm being suggested to cry 😭 😂 this mood option is hilarious, lol. anyone out there without the live lyrics yet? yall when is it gonna be available for all users 😭 it’s not like it is a big deal but i find annoying to see some people have it and others don’t i didn’t need to be called out like that 😂 my recap i use just the youtube app and not youtube music but i still get a recap 😝 finally got my recap! as you can probably tell... i'm pretty monotonous when it comes to my music 😅 album title search seems broken. searching for albums brings up everything except that album. anyone else? moods filters are back with more mixes! i got the moods filters back! “cry” is now “sad” and for each mood, there are a couple of own mixes. new cast banner this appears every time when i play a song, is really annoying disappointing man this update to the homepage is so 😕\n",
      "\n",
      "at least make the listen again permanent at the top how can i make the cast icon disappear and make the skip song icon appear, it bothers me i'm no graphic designer, but the youtube music user interface has such a sad vibe. drab, pale, lots of black and white. compares poorly to the vibrant colors you find on apple music and elsewhere. who decided that the original versions of folklore should be on the disney+ album? and how can i get them promoted to customer? i think it's cause of streaming counts, but idk. it's so annoying! my winter recap does not showing up. how can i do it finally, it's happening 👍 these playlist titles are... interesting how to stop duplicate likes in playlist the yeji song air is duolicated. i'm afraid to unlike because that may remove both copies from my playlist. any advice? how can i separate these kind of videos from the actual music on the most played playlist? i love yt music but wish the videos didn't do this specially on the most played playlist cause it puts anything i play on normal youtube making weird things like this. top listening artist tingz recap is finally here!! my recap is so wrong, feels like they collected data only from the first few months. i was on bit of ari's phase during february, but since then i listen to tate 24/7. it truly feels like they completely ignored everything from march/april till now. my 2024 recap !! we need custom covers! we need the option to customize our playlists, also the shuffle button visibly. something similar to this, let's hope ytm takes it into account soon and surprises us. 😍 section for artists' hits i would love if there was a section on the main screen that shows the playlists of the artists. the radio sucks anytime i start a radio it just plays music from my playlists, for instance i started a radio from an impressionist piano composition and it started playing tyler the creator, what the hell? sabrina invadedy my speed dial i listened to one sabrina song and i'm immediately bombarded by everything she ever posted and also where the hell did the thick of it pop up in my speed dial. it's a speed dial not a death dile. youtube music on tv is so buggy bro 🤦‍♂️ every time i add a song to the queue in my phone, the lyrics on the tv would just freeze. why no percentage??? when i got my recap this year, it didn't give me a percentage to show how much i've listened to cannibal corpse.  did anyone else have this problem? i have the most npc recap ever. i challenge anyone to have a more npc recap. 86% of the songs in my playlist have over 100m views https://youtube. speed dial came back from apple music to youtube music and i\n",
      "love this speed dial feature. i'm the type of listener who goes back to my last played album, song, or artist and see my mood through that and this feature is great for me. no yt recap yet... 😐 sooooo am i the only one? lol 🤣 just arrived oh nah folks its not even thanksgiving yet total listening time on youtube music i basically always have music playing in the background while i go on about my daily life— but i didn’t realize how much so until i got my yt music recap lol (63,418 minutes!) i think i've absolutely confused my ytm algorithm... is here comes the sun a sad song? youtube thinks it is auto play no longer an option? my autoplay button at the bottom of playlists no longer appears. it's not even on my liked playlist. is anyone having this problem? i really liked that option and it's weird it's just gone i like this season's one it actually felt correct finally judge me! (99% of my minutes are from the top 3 artists btw) i love youtube and youtube music. for only $7.99 a month, i get many great features. i've never felt it was a waste of money. show me your recap 🔊 my recap is random is fuck 18000min &) i have no words honestly.  the descendants album being my top album is so funny lmao 😭 this has to be a mistake right? on my playlist yt made it doesn't have all of these songs in this order. i think my depression shined a bit too brightly this year 🫣 my recappp!! first time for everything; my recap was actually fairly accurate for once! surprised billie eilish didn't somehow supercede some of these artists because of the one time i listened to happier than ever. youtube does like to do that to me normally. i have disliked this music and it still popped up, damn gipsy music. never ever listened to such music type... this happened with multiple genres of music, despite the dislike. disliked music must not be suggested. ios26 iphone 15 pro max my mix 01 has music i loath and i dont know why or how to stop it showing me generic pop. i have never liked these bands and i spend 20 mins downvoting an entire playlist… but it persists in showing me these god awful radio bangers by … how do i fix this? this popped up in my memories on fb. reminding me of the good ol days of free music samplers. will ytm ever add \"composer\" to the displays? seems designed for only \"pop\" music. what the hell is this algorithm? i have it plays in 2000s j-pop and it just jumps me into city pop and then video game music and then a song that's completely in english from the wrong country. can anyone explain to me why this connection issue keeps popping up every 5 or 10 minutes? gpm never did this. i dont understand why play music is going away. its so much better imo does anyone know how to turn off these \"inappropriate or offensive\" warnings how to go around age verification? i just got this on youtube music. i am of age, but there's not a single chance i'm giving youtube my id. is there anything i can download to circumvent this pop-up??? this is absolutely ridiculous. every recap i see is just heavy metal lovers. where are my pop girlie's or pop boys? i feel alone😅 new to youtube music, why is it playing a cover??? i'm on the album page for the kpop demon hunters soundtrack, and trying to play songs from it instead plays lyric videos and covers instead of the normal song video?? bro this is so annoying... i thought this is only on normal youtube but in youtube music as well?? i want have background playing and not having this to pop-up each 30 minutes d: i’m going on 3 days of my music so downloading…. i had to factory reset my iphone and have i would very good, or just good internet at least. i don’t know exactly how many songs it’s downloading but surely it’s 100s. this can’t be normal for it to still be downloading this slow?? why does youtube music replace all songs from an official playlist with amvs and in one case a cover? new ai generated radios i've just received this feature and it allows to prompt ai to which it will respond with a custom radio (in my example the prompt was something like \"some queer hip hop hits\"). i think it's pretty cool i don’t think i’m getting my recap why lower numbers/cutoff? why are the percentages so low in the genre recap, and what are the ones with cutoff names? why can't youtube music just show lyrics on web like they do on tv ?, the web version is so ugly looking non - functional help everytime i select not interested in any song, this error pops up, i've tried clearing cache, restarting my phone and even deleting and installing yt music again. i genuinely don't know what to do i use headphones and my music is really low quality. what should  u change about the settings youtubemucis notified me about music i never listened to i received a notification about hip hop or pop music about new releases, but this is music, which i'm not a fan of. i'm a metalhead. why youtube suggest me such kind of music? do you have similar problems? youtube music, i do not like the coachella mix you gave me, how do i change it? there is green day and a couple other good songs but i dont want any boring pop! i only listen to rock and this will stay. huh…. love it  i’m really surprised em got #1st place considering starting only in october why can't ytmusic ui on ipad be like this in landscape mode, instead of showing album art in full screen mode? why do my mixes no longer have names ? :( i think yt music is making fun of me- youtube music recap why does my recap not work it says this when ever i click it is it fixable? i found out that you can actually listen to live streams on yt music! why is my recap empty? is it a region thing? i've been using ytm this whole year not even the season recap iphone 15 and yt music bug there is a bug when switch to video by rotating the phone and the rotate back to the regular screen. anyone else have this issue? how do i fix this i can’t find my youtube recap and this is what shows up even tho other people i’ve talked to got it to work music shuffle does anyone have this issue pop up? i’m on wifi and it still doesn’t work. if so, does anyone have any ideas on how to fix the issue? new home screen it's cool to see playlist are getting recommended, but this is not the way. i don't want \"mood\" playlists, i want my mixes and playlists from youtube music non mood related. the \"more from\" is ok but i don't want to have 3 rows of \"more from\" on my home screen lol artist not showing up first maybe i've been under a rock but when did youtube music start placing the artist so low when you search for them. like why am i getting community playlist before the artist pop up anyone noticed how short pop songs have become? heaps of them under 3 minutes, over 4 minutes is now rare. i guess it has to do with the algorithm? ruined library! the new update just ruined my music libra by including video playlist from my youtube library my summer recap was definitely summer vibes this year. last year was mostly pop/rap. this appears in my homepage. i'm glad to know that they are trying new things/features in the app i can't find my playlist on pc but i can find it on mobile? i cant even find the recap anymore does yt music have a strong latino following? i always find it interesting at how many latino songs are on the us top songs chart. i mainly listen to pop music and haven't heard of many of these songs or artist. maybe i'm just showing my millennial and am really out of touch. recommendations anybody else is having this pop-up? when i pick a quick pick song it will give me a good queue but when i skip a song it'll refresh and change the whole queue for songs totally out of the ones i'd like to hear. approximately 25% of my \"likes\" are k-pop songs. how come my new release mix never, ever includes a single korean song? seriously, why? am i just unlucky? does the new release mix exclude any music from other countries? is it a licensing thing? any way to get rid of “viewer discretion advised”? its really annoying when it pops up and stops my music. hate the new chromecast ui. weird window-in-window pop up on the new google chromecast with google tv that i can't get rid of. what is \"children's music\"? i have absolutely no idea what songs i listened to that are under that category? youtube music app broke chromecast when i open the youtube music app on chromecast its redirecting to the main youtube app. how to i fix this? i don't see anything about this in settings and its super annoying to have political videos pop up when listening to music. artists who can match the lyrical genius of taylor swift i have been completely enamored with taylor swift's songwriting for a long time. i'd like to find more artists that rival her when it comes to lyrics. what would you suggest?

      "thanks. i googled billie eilish, but i still don’t know who she is and why she is trending. she turned 18 and is a weird looking emo singer. so what is the big deal? why does reddit seem to hate billie eilish so much? why for people seem to hate / dislike billie eilish so much? i'm really out of the loop with popular culture lately... what did she do to have people dislike her as much? who is billie eilish and why do people love or hate her so much? why do i see \"billie liked this!!\" on like every single instagram post?? and most of the time billie eilish didn't actually like the post?? billie eilish my friend is a really really big fan of billie eilish and her music. but, they just don’t have tickets to billies your where she lives at. and she is very upset because she really wants to see her in person. i don’t want her to be sad so what should i tell her? that billie eilish song \"wish you were gay\".. can someone explain the meaning behind this song for me? \n",
      "\n",
      "like, is she gay or does she hope the guy was gay so they wouldn't be interested in each other? why are there many songs about women ridiculing poor men? * no scrubs - tlc\n",

      "* bills bills bills - destiny's child\n",
      "* up - cardi b\n",

      "\\*edit: i'm a fucking moron why are beyoncé fans mad that she has never won the artist of the year grammy? she has 35 grammys, the most-awarded artist in history. i don’t understand. grammy non-us viewers? how many viewers of the grammy’s do not reside in the united states? is it something people pay attention to outside of the united states? i cannot find the answers on google. why isn’t the best original song in a movie a category for the grammys instead of the oscars?  it’s an award for music so why isn’t that put in the grammy awards instead? why do the simpsons dunk on the grammys so much? i know this sound kind of dumb but there are some many jokes about it. i was just wondering whats so bad about it? will demi ever win a grammy? she is a powerhouse singer i don’t understand why she hasn’t won a grammy she is up there with whitney, mariah and jennifer hudson she should of wrong a grammy by now what’s wrong with people? americans of reddit, is the grammy's really a joke of an award show? i saw this simpsons clip, and it seems it's making fun of the grammy's. is it really that of a joke?\n",
      "\n",
      "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cofjknhr8xq the grammys i have read time and time again that the grammys are rigged, but have never come across evidence. why do so many people think that the grammys are rigged? are the grammys not streamed live? the grammys aren’t supposed to be on for another 3 hours but how come all the awards are already being announced? is it not live? kanye west is one of the richest black man in us history, now is the first artist in the 21st century to billboard #1 on 10 albums, and has 22 grammys. how is he so successful? he’s basically one of the biggest artists ever, and one of the most successful black person ever. americans: what the heck is a \"meemaw\" (fyi love the way it sounds, and now that i know, i want my future grandkids to call my wife meemaw) if art is subjective then why do we have award shows for movies/songs like oscars and grammys? doesn't that go against the the subjectivity of music. is hip hop/rap a not respected genre by lots of people and reward ceremonies like the grammys because it’s black dominated? why did kanye west pee on a grammy? every year there is an article saying \"grammy/oscar/superbowl ratings hit all-time low\" but isn't that just because tv is going down in general in favor of streaming? why doesn't reddit promote a kind of reward like the oscars or grammys but for their subs? why hasn't sia won any grammys even though her songs are good? how come children’s music (nursery rhymes and lullaby’s) never win any awards? (grammy’s) why do some people can their grandmother grammy? i get granny, since it is *gran*dmother, but where did these ms magically come from? how did the academy awards and grammys manage to become more \"important\" than other awards? i mean, award shows are inherently meaningless to begin with, but why do people seem to value a film that won an oscar more so than one that won a golden globe? how can a musician such as beyonce win so many awards, 22 grammy awards in total as well as countless nominations. is she really that good and deserving of all this critical acclaim? why do celebrities wear the craziest outfits in the grammys? does this have anything to do with the themes from the songs nominated at the grammys or do they just do it for the hell of it? why isn’t childish gambino at the grammys? it seems like he was top contender and one of the favorites going into it, why didn’t e show up? why do the grammys get sh*t on more than any other award show? so much that the simpsons made a skit about how bad they are?\n",
      "\n",
      "like, how come the oscars aren't considered a joke? what the fuck was going on with ceelo green at the grammys? i heard a song in the grammy 2015? i only remember one line - \"the war is not won by an individual\". i need to find the song because i absolutely loved it. sorry if the question is too stupid. i don't get this onion headline: \"phil spector joins jennifer hudson to present 'best new artist' grammy\" http://www.theonion.com/articles/phil-spector-joins-jennifer-hudson-to-present-best,37963/\n",

      "phil spector is in jail for murder, maybe that's part of it? why do celebrities dress like that at galas and such ? it always seems that celebrities at the oscars, grammys, etc, are in a competition for the weirdest looking outfit. what makes not like us so universally recognised? i'm not a connoisseur of rap or music generally what is up with kendrick lamar saying “no minor” sorry i’m european and i see a lot of videos about it but have no idea what’s going on i don’t know if it’s just my family, but did anyone else’s parents make you step on their back as a kid? whenever my parents backs would hurt, they would lay on the ground and tell me to step on their back to soothe the pain, is it just me? why do most relevant events in the world happen in the us? the emmys, grammys, oscars, met gala, etc, why in the us and not like, france ? do people really still care about hollywood awards? oscars, grammy used to have some sort of prestige, but now i couldn’t care less…\n",
      "\n",
      "is it just me or do you think those stuff is just bs? do most of you call your mother-in-law...mom? it's never felt comfortable to me as much as i love her. did louis ck's humor change after he got cancelled? i haven't seen the special he recently won a grammy for so i don't know. as a non-sports fan, can someone explain to me why this messi world cup win is so massive ? it is literally everywhere on every page. i don’t think i’ve ever seen a sports final so massively popular across all platforms. what’s the big deal, and why is everyone so hyped about it? how did zach braff win an oscar for garden state when he just picked music he liked and slapped it on a cd? i love the movie by the way\n",

      "\n",
      "they really need to learn what background music means and turn this down by like 50% at least why does there exist crazy frog versions only of modern pop music songs and not of oldies like greensleaves, the sibelius' finlandia, or la marseillaise? why don't they make fun pop music like the early 2010s anymore? why does japanese pop music seem to have lost its global influence? what exactly is “wrong” with liking pop music? my spotify wrapped summed up favorite genre as “pop” for three years.\n",

      "no, i don’t give a fuck. just curious as to why it bothers other people. why can't i find much sheet music for pop songs in spanish? like luis miguel or any very big mexican groups. if i find sheet music for them, it tends to be just like 3 of their songs. what is the deal with all the yacht references going on in pop culture and especially music? why is pop music dominated by 3-4-minute long songs with a verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus format? why more artists switch this up? why is all pop music 99% of sad songs nowadays? who is even listening to the pop music in radio? it always gets dozens of millions views and i didnt meet a single person that likes this kind of music why is it acceptable for pop standards to have songs like “that old black magic” and “witchcraft” but then say rock music is the devil’s music? i'm i too old to start learning music or dance 24. years wanted pop star when i was kid but i'm from india so no entry for me to western singing shows i almost give up but recently saw k-pop audition but now i'm late twenties what should i do 🥺 should i try or not i have been seeing a picture of a redhead with a guitaro for a few days. a guy plays some music in his car and that face pops up. the song was a banger. why are all my searches for his music reactions or op eds saying hes too a or b? why does so much spanish pop music use that beat that goes like (quarter note triplet)+(eighth note triplet)+(eighth note)+(eighth note)? example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a1icrjqscg&t=59s what was that very lewd k-pop music video? i cant seem to remember, but contained scenes of some milk being poured on the idols, and was very lewd, id even go as far as to say the most nsfw music video in a korean's standpoint pop music is the best kind of music. agree or disagree? what genre of music is pop punk mixed with rap? it’s my favorite but i don’t know what it’s called. if it doesn’t have a name yet i pick, rop runk what musician had almost equal fame and success in both pop music and classical music in his or her lifetime? why do people dislike electronic music so much but not really once you add vocals to make it a pop or rap song? how does all pop music manage to sound the same? why do i feel bad about myself for liking mainstream pop music? i have no idea why but i always hesitate to tell people i mainly listen to pop music because i feel bad about myself for liking it why is cnn even bothering to do a special on carole king and james taylor knowing that the dominant form of music is pop and rap? i like tapestry, but i'm guessing most viewers won't even care. why do people stop liking hit pop music as they get older and only want to listen to the stuff that was popular when they were younger? why does it feel like pop music hasn't changed much in the last 15 years, when it used to change drastically every 5 years or so in the 60s, 70s, and 80s? how do i ban travis scott’s music from popping up on spotify. after what happened i do not wanna support him or his music. why are corny lyrics corny in western music but not in k-pop? what's that annoying k-pop music that's in those google commercials? asking so i know exactly which song and artist to avoid. how can pro wrestling still be considered the lowest art form when there are musicals based on 90's movies and pop albums? is country music just pop music with a southern accent? what even is country music? does it even exist? why does the average person's singing voice sound good when singing regular church music and national anthems but sound bad when singing other songs like pop songs and love songs that only singers can sing well? why does 1950s-1970s easy-listening/traditional pop music sound so dystopian? why is classical music so unpopular among young people/ pop culture hi i live in the us and study at juilliard, i want the peoples opinion. what do you have against classical music? i feel like no one my age listens to it. is it normal to have listened to so much pop music recently that you just feel sick of it and like you need to be done for awhile? why does no one find it super weird that regular adults watch super hero movies and listen to pop music mainly created for preteen audiences? how do we compare musical greatness? how is bethoven compared statistically or qualitatively to say justin beiber or cardi b. why is pop radio said to be terrible if more people listen to it than anything else in history? is the lock down going to become a huge barrier to the future of pop music, or will it’s affect on music fade in a short amount of time? why are some actual rock songs referred to as “pop songs” by music journalists? i’ve seen in numerous publications nirvana’s nevermind referred to as pop. this is just one example. what do people mean when they refer to pop music, and why is it so hated by everyone i meet? why is pop music so fucking terrible?! i just can't put my finger on it, buts it's annoying as hell why do we feel like pop music is getting more and more terrible? is it just an impression caused by the sorting bias (the fact that our brain mostly remembers the good things from the past) ?\n"
